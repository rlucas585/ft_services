Telegraf stuff

		This one is the plugin for input from kube_inventory, which gives info like state_code
	https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/release-1.12/plugins/inputs/kubernetes/README.md
		This one is the plugin for input from the cluster in general, but I haven't managed
		to get it working properly (but it may not be necessary).

Setting up phpmyadmin

Ongoing issues
	
	- I've not been able to get the Metrics working correctly through telegraf,
	although the dashboard is able to get the metrics.

	- The commands at the end of the /tmp/final.sql in the MySQL container
	aren't being run - I can't tell why, but it may not be too significant

	- Wordpress isn't appearing yet at all, but I think I should go an alternative
	route to using wordpress (through wp-cli).
	Before that, I'd like to go over mysql however and make sure I can connect
	to it from the wordpress container.

Last things

	- MySQL is broken now, since restarting minikube
	Pretty sure its something to do with permissions, of /var/run/mysqld in
	particular, and /var/lib/mysql
	- I think I should simply run the mysql as a docker container, and try
	to figure out step by step how to initialize the mysql server - i think
	with the `mysqld --initialize` command.

Log

	1124 - It looks like I've correctly configured the MySQL dockerfile now,
	now the Databases that I've added have been created correctly, and the
	container works immediately. Additionally, `mysql` can be run immediately
	without specifying a user when `kubectl exec`'ing into the container.
	The wordpress database is created as well. AND the data is persistent.

	1348 - After a stupid amount of time being confused, turned out that I was
	creating a user on MySQL called 'mysql'@'localhost' - this is obviously
	only going to work on localhost. I created the same user without the
	localhost parameter, and now wp core install works correctly.
	Now I have to setup wordpress correctly through nginx so that I can
	see the site.
