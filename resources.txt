Telegraf stuff

		This one is the plugin for input from kube_inventory, which gives info like state_code
	https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/release-1.12/plugins/inputs/kubernetes/README.md
		This one is the plugin for input from the cluster in general, but I haven't managed
		to get it working properly (but it may not be necessary).

Setting up phpmyadmin

Ongoing issues
	
	- I've not been able to get the Metrics working correctly through telegraf,
	although the dashboard is able to get the metrics.

	- The commands at the end of the /tmp/final.sql in the MySQL container
	aren't being run - I can't tell why, but it may not be too significant

	- Wordpress isn't appearing yet at all, but I think I should go an alternative
	route to using wordpress (through wp-cli).
	Before that, I'd like to go over mysql however and make sure I can connect
	to it from the wordpress container.
